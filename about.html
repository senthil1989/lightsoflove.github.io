            <p class="lead">As the sun's rays reach everything throughout the world, so did we wish to have our light
              of love reach those who are in need. We people in Light of Love come from diverse
              backgrounds. We mostly had the same alma mater, so in addition to being friends, we
              tutored together. A group of 15 people constitutes the core of the team. People from the
              software industry, businessmen, marketing gurus, medical transcriptionist, homemakers,
              auditors, and filmmakers are in attendance. While we work from different places, have
              different jobs, and live at different times zones (yes, we live across the globe), we still work
              together for a common cause. A commitment to a cause goes beyond financial support,
              but also includes serving time, presence, and bringing new projects. Every member of our
              team takes turns to drive a project from initiation until the smiles reappear.</p>

            <p class="lead">We have learned so much from our society, and we live our lives of contentment, but is
              that enough to make it through this life. As we grow economically, it is important for us
              to make sure people without privileges are guided and supported with life's elixir â€“
              Education along with basic human needs such as food, clean water, clothes, and place to
              stay and survive in this world.</p>

              unsure. Our community composed of friends and likeminded individuals kept the urge
              and spark alive. On a casual call, we discussed about an Aboriginal elder, who travelled
              3000 KMS to dance with his granddaughter for graduating her 10th grade. This struck
              the chord, and we resurfaced the idea of creating first-generation graduates.</p>

              Accumulating funds to convert our ideas to reality was a real-world challenge as we did
              not come from affluent families and collecting financial aid was a difficult task. To ease
              the process, we promised to contribute a meagre sum of Rs.500/- per month in order to
              make the arrangements feasible for everyone. That was the agreed upon as a minimum
              contribution, and anything extra was always appreciated.</p>

              <p class="lead">Our domestic help children were also asked, but most of them were financially independent or were educated and employed. Fortunately, we were able to find someone who had the information from someone we knew. We were surprised to find that our friend's mother, working in a government school, had heard about us through her son and was looking for assistance for her student, who is highly capable in her academic studies, but unable to pay for her education.</p>

We did not discuss further, so we just paid the fees, and she is now a top student in her class and is proficient in the Japanese language. Stories like this encouraged us to keep striving as we looked for people to assist further down the line.</p>

She has helped us in identifying further projects. A government primary school needed flooring, as the cement floors have crumbled, and students had to sit down in class, causing not only the uniforms to get damaged but also putting their health at risk.</p>

In light of the funds we had in our account and the costs needed, we had to pitch in extra and ask our close circle for donations. After we finished the project, we were overwhelmed by the joy on the children faces. Any words written will only be adequate to describe it.</p>

As we came out of the principal's room, we saw children running past us; as we stopped a kid and asked where they were running, he said happily they had carrom boards and chess boards that had arrived. If he runs now, he can get to them. An overwhelming feeling flooded us as we let him go.</p>

Our tailor delivered the work on time after we had paid the tailor in full while the clothes of oneness were being completed.</p>
